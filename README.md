# Roller_coaster_analysis
This project involves data analysis of a roller coaster dataset sourced from Kaggle, originally scraped from Wikipedia.  The analysis was conducted using Python, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to uncover trends and insights about roller coasters.

# Dataset
Sourced from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/rollercoaster-database. 
The dataset consists of several columns like coaster_name,Length,Speed	Location,Status etc

# Project Structure
**1. Data Import & Initial Exploration**
- Imported necessary Python libraries
- Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Performed initial data inspection to understand its structure and content
**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Dropped irrelevant columns and rows
- Identified and handled duplicated columns
- Renamed columns for better readability and consistency
- Created new features for deeper analysis
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Univariate Analysis
- Visualized individual feature distributions using:
- Histograms
- Kernel Density Estimates (KDE)
- Boxplots

**4. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
- Explored relationships between features using:
- Scatterplots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Pairplots
- Grouped comparisons (e.g., using groupby operations)

**#Tools & Libraries Used**
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Insights**
Busch Gardens Williamsburg has the highest average coaster speed.
